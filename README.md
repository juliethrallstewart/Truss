# Instructions to view app locally

- Fork the repository and copy the url
- In your terminal, run command 'git clone 'url-link''
- cd into the 'planets' folder
- Run command 'yarn start'

## Included libraries

- React Table [react-table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/quick-start)

## Completed Tasks

- The planet's name
- The name should be a link that, when clicked, opens the planet's API URL in a new window
- The planet's climate
- How many residents the planet has
- The terrains found on the planet
- The population
- The surface area covered by water in percentage rounded to nearest integer
- Show a loading message while loading the data, and hide this message once the data is displayed.
- Display an error message if the data load fails for some reason. We may test your code against an invalid URL to demonstrate this.
- Any column that is unknown should be displayed as ?
- Cells in the table should be separated by 1 pixel gray lines.

## In progress tasks

- Format all numbers larger than 999 with spaces to group digits into groups of three. For example, ten thousand should be displayed as 10 000.
- Sort the planets alphabetically

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
